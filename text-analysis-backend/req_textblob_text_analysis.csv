2024-05-08T15:02:30.473852,"I am trying to set a docker image for domain ai-dev.site. The website I want to develop consists of a front-end React and a back-end Flask, both docker images uploaded. Then I set Docker Proxy Rules for them to be accessible. When clicking on “Preview” button, the url works fine, but the button for “Open in web” does not work. In the tab “Hosting & DNS” I can see that “Domain is not resolvable”. The website was accessible fine when clicking on “Open in web” prior to setting up the Docker Proxy Rules.
Maybe the issue is related to Proxy Rules? All I find online relates to a “Proxy Rules” button but it is not present.
As you can see, with Plesk, I'm confused on how I am supposed to organize nginx in order to have a domain serve docker images. Should I make modifications to local files on the server? If so, where? I saw some files that detailed some proxy rules but they specify they should not be modified.
